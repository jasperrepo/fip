                       <p> Touching is healing; from a mothers touch which comforts<br>
                        and soothes her baby to the triumphant athlete patted on the back by fellow athletes.<br>
                        Based on the same principle as human touch, massage is the oldest method<br>
                        of promoting good health, suppleness and strength.<br>
                        Today, the role of massage therapy is recognized by the general public and other<br>
                        health care professionals as being an effective health care alternative.<br>
                        Due to public perception and desire, massage Therapy has grown into a more prominent position.<br>
                        It is a viable and respected profession promoting good health not only
                        for your physical but emotional well being also.<br>
                        Massage Therapy is the kneading, manipulation or application of methodical pressure and friction of the body.<br>
                        Whether it is for treatment of injury, stress or for relaxation,<br>
                        the skilled use of massage through touch is used to maintain and enhance<br>
                        the health and well being of the entire body.<br>
